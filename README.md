# bytez

Package **bytez** provides functionality for working with large byte sizes and capacities in a
human-friendly way in the belief that code and configuration files are more readable and less
error-prone when they are specified with, for example, "4MiB" rather than "4194304".

The 'z' in the name is not an attempt to be cute but rather to create a package name that is
short yet unique.
