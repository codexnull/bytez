# bytez

Package **bytez** provides functionality for working with large byte sizes in a human-friendly
way. Code and configuration files are more readable and less error-prone when sizes and capacities
are specified with, for example, "4MiB" rather than "4194304".
 
The 'z' in the name is not an attempt to be cutesy but rather to create a package name that is
short yet unique.
